# üïµÔ∏è Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark: Investigating a Compromised Workstation

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world network forensics case where a workstation within an organization accesses a compromised website. Using Wireshark, I demonstrate how to perform packet capture, filter and analyze protocols, identify security anomalies, and trace potential compromise paths.

The goal is to showcase practical skills in network traffic analysis and incident investigation using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this investigation, you will:

* Understand the concept and importance of network traffic analysis.
* Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network communication across various protocols.
* Determine the root cause of network issues using packet analysis.
* Navigate and utilize Wireshark panes, capture filters, and display filters.
* Identify common protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP) and how to isolate traffic by ports and IPs.
* Extract forensic evidence such as User-Agent headers and follow TCP streams.

## üîç Step-by-Step Investigation

### Step 1: Load and Navigate Wireshark

* Open the provided `.pcap` file in Wireshark.

* <img width="1077" alt="01-Open Pcap File in WireShark" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc210f18-d9ca-4d44-9f7a-28be1fbbf7a8" />


 
* Explore the **Packet List Pane**, **Packet Details Pane**, and **Packet Bytes Pane**.

**Packets List Pane**

### Step 2: Apply Protocol Filters

| Filter                               | Purpose                             |
| ----------------                     | ----------------------------------- |
| `tcp`                                | Display TCP traffic                 |
| `udp`                                | Display UDP traffic                 |
| `icmp`                               | Display ICMP traffic                |
| `tcp.port == 80`                     | Filters for all TCP traffic on port 80, typically HTTP traffic.     |
| `ip.addr==192.168.248.171`           | Isolate all traffic from the investiagted system.      |

**Filter all TCP traffic**

**Filter all UDP traffic**

**Filter all ICMP traffic**

**Filter all TCP traffic pn port 80 only (HTTP traffic)**

**Isolate all traffic from the investiagted system 192.168.248.171**

### Step 3: Investigate HTTP Headers

* Filter: `http.request`to determine the compromised employee‚Äôs operating system and the version of Chrome used during the compromise.

**HTTP Request to get more information about the investigated system**

* Drill down to inspect the **User-Agent** header

**Use User-Agent to extract more information**
<img width="1250" alt="12-User Agent " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a700af-eeee-4cb6-8b78-31a7b4166152" />


* Extract OS and browser version used by the compromised machine

**User-Agent Information**

### Step 4: Follow TCP Streams

* Use `tcp.stream eq 1` (where 1 is the stream number)

* Right-click ‚Üí Follow ‚Üí TCP Stream to reconstruct conversations

**TCP Stream to follow the full conversation of the investigated machine with any specific server**
<img width="1255" alt="14-TCP Stream" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751477e1-d802-4844-a2c9-b47458afd4b4" />



* Identify suspicious payloads, login attempts, or data exfiltration

**Check to see any suspicious activities from the conversations**

### Step 5: Advanced Filtering

* Combine filters: `ip.addr == 192.168.248.171 && tcp.port == 80`

**Use of logical operators to combine more than one filter**

* Use `tcp.analysis.flags` to identify retransmissions or anomalies

**Check for retransmission anomalies**
